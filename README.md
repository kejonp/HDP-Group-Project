This project is an implementation of a heart disease prediction system using fuzzy system

left ventricular hypertrophy and bundle branch blocks.
### Maximum heart rate
- This input shows the maximum heart rate of a person during 24 ours.
### The amount of thallium
- This input specifies the amount of thalliumin a person's body. This input is
a crisp value and it can be only three values: 3, 6, and 7. If the amount of thallium is three, it is "normal", if it six
then the amount of thalliym is "Average" and if it is 7, thallium is "high".

a man, and if it is one, it means that the patient is a woman.
